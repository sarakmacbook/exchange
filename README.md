# 🤖 P2P Merchant Price Bot for Telegram

One‑click Telegram bot that watches specific **P2P merchants** on **Binance, Bybit, OKX and Bitget**
and posts their **best selling price** (merchant sells → you buy) and **best buying price**
(merchant buys → you sell) to your Telegram group — automatically every time the price changes.

## ✨ Features
- 🔗 **Paste a public merchant URL** to the bot → merchant is added instantly (no commands).
- 📊 **One button** posts all merchant prices to your group right now.
- 🟢 **One button** turns auto‑posting ON/OFF (posts only when a price changes).
- 📋 Merchant list with one‑click remove.
- Any asset (USDT, USDC, BTC…) against any fiat (USD, EUR, AED, …).
- Interactive setup — the script asks for token/ID on first run. No `.env`, no API keys.
